# **WstÄ™p do programowania Python - 28.10**

## **Python Features**

-   Dynamic typing,
-   Whitespace is part of syntax,
-   Language of data science,
-   Endorses Object Programming,

## **Notes**

-   Print methos works like console.log in JS,
-   '+' operathor is used for string contatination,
-   Pyhon doesn't use EOL character,
-   Unexpected indentations causes compilation errors,

### **Declaring Variables**

Variable naming conventions

**Accepted**
Variable names are case-sensitive. Accepted variable names are listed below. Can use camelCase.

```py
# Legal Variable Names
myvar = 'John'
my_var = 'John'
_my_var = 'John'
myVar = 'John'
MYVAR = 'John'
myvar2 = 'John'
```

**Unaccepted**

Variable names cannot start with intiger, can't include space
between characters ot have white space between them.

```py
# Illegal Variable Names
2myvar = 'John'
my-var = 'John'
my var = 'John'
```

**Example**

Example of variables declaration, print and input methods.
Comments in Python are created with '#' charaacter in fron of it.

```py
userName = input('Please input your name: ')
catName = input("Please input your cat's name: ")
print ('Your name is ' + userName + 'and your cat name is ' + catName)
```

### **Conditional Statements**

There is no "block" syntax in "if" statement in Python, there is just simply whitespace.Strict comparison operator is double equality symbol (in JS it's three).'elif' is 'else if' in Python but 'else' stays the same.

```py
a = 5
b = 5

if a>b:
    print('a is bigger than b')
elif a==b:
    print('a is equal to b')
else:
    print('Other case')
```

We don't use any kind of keyword for creating variables, we just need to put down variables name.
